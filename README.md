# Rocket Grid
A TypeScript library to allow for easy interaction with the Roblox Grid Service and Thumbnail Relay.

I took inspiration from [this project](https://github.com/megahdrive/rccclient-node) but I have refactored a lot of the code and added improvements

## Installation
```
npm i https://github.com/Yalp-Development/Grid.git
```

### An example on how to use this library can be found [here](https://github.com/Yalp-Development/Grid/blob/master/src/test.ts)
